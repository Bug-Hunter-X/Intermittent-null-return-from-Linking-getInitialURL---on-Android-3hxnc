This bug occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links on Android.  The `getInitialURL()` method sometimes returns `null` even when a deep link is opened, causing the app to not handle the link correctly. This is inconsistent and not well-documented, making debugging difficult.  The issue seems to be intermittent and doesn't occur consistently across all devices or Android versions.
